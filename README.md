# RandomPasswordGenerator

# IMPORTANT, my brother and I got into a fight and he deleted my homework repositories. I wanted to let the graders know since the initial commit is going to have everything and will look like the assignment is late. If you need more info on why it happened etc. email me I plan to let my instructor know tomorrow as well

The password generator lets you choose to use special characters, numbers, upper and lowercase letters. The password can be anywhere from 8 to 128 characters in length.
